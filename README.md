This project was written as a objective-c console application for OSX.


1. Get the data from TXT1 and TXT2 then store it in arrays.

2. Sort Array1 then Sort Array2 and delete Array2 value from Array1.

I build this project to fix an error we was facing during a mix of database data.

I hope that this will be useful for you all, Its very simple and clean.
